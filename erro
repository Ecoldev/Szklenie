ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'ansible.builtin.firewalld'. This often indicates a mis missing collection, or incorrect module path.

The error appears to be in '/home/devops/ansible_playbooks/install_vsftpd.yml': line 16, colu may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:


    - name: Konfiguracja firewalld - dodanie us≈Çugi FTP
      ^ here


ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix

ansible-doc -l | grep firewalld
